# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a text-editor application! It can be used on your browser or even offline, and it will save your data!
Through this project I learned how to configure Webpack for making Progressive Web Applications.
Link to the application can be found here: https://limitless-beyond-02394.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

Run 'npm i' inside of the project's root directory. This will install all of the necessary packages for this application.

Then, run 'npm run build' inside of the client folder. This will create your 'dist' folder, which is essential for the client.

Finally, run 'npm run start' in your root directory to run the server locally.

## Usage

This application will open on your local browser at localhost:3000.
